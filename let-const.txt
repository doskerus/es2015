What is the difference between var and let?

You can redeclare and reassign values with var.
Let can be reassigned but not redeclared (unlike var).
When defined in a function, the var keyword scopes a variable to that function.
The let keyword creates a block-scoped variable: a variable that only exists inside a code block (any pair of curly braces outside of object syntax).
Var will hoist to the top of the scope it is defined in but let do not!


What is the difference between var and const?

You can redeclare and reassign values with var.
The const keyword prevents a variable from ever being reassigned or redeclared.
When defined in a function, the var keyword scopes a variable to that function.
Const is also block-scoped, like let.
Var will hoist to the top of the scope it is defined in but const do not!

What is hoisting?

The way JavaScript is structured can lead to variable hoisting, where variables are used before they are declared.
Var will hoist to the top of the scope it is defined in.
Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase.
